A Gravity Forms Add-On to feed submission data into the Engaging Networks CRM/fundraising/advocacy platform.

== Description ==

If you're using the [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/) plugin, you can now integrate it with the [Engaging Networks](https://www.engagingnetworks.net/) platform. This Add-On supports creating or updating basic supporter records, either as standalone or within the context of EN Page Builder pages.

To use this Add-On, you'll need to:

1. Have an licensed, active version of Gravity Forms >= 1.9.3
2. Have a working Engaging Networks instance
3. Configure your Engaging Networks account to have an API key and support connections from your server's IP address(es).

If you meet those requirements, this plugin is for you, and should make building new forms and passing supporter data into EN much easier than manually mucking with HTML provided by Engaging Networks.

*Initial development of this plugin was funded in part by [Access Now](https://accessnow.org/). Subsequent development was funded in part by [Amnesty International USA](https://www.amnestyusa.org/).*

== Installation ==

1. Log into your WordPress account and go to Plugins > Add New. Search for "Gravity Forms Engaging Networks" in the "Add plugins" section, then click "Install Now". Once it installs, it will say "Activate". Click that and it should say "Active". Alternatively, you can upload the gravityforms-en directory directly to your plugins directory (typically /wp-content/plugins/)
2. Navigate to Forms > Settings in the WordPress admin
3. Click on "Engaging Networks" in the lefthand column of that page
4. Enter your organization's ID as well as a valid API key for your Engaging Networks account.
5. Once you've entered your Engaging Networks account details, create a form or edit an existing form's settings. You'll see an "Engaging Networks" tab in settings where you can create a feed. This allows you to pick and choose which form fields you'll send over to EN from the form, including the Page Builder page to assign responses to. You also have the option of setting some conditional logic to pick and choose which information gets sent.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Help! I can't get this plugin to get any data from Engaging Networks! What should I do? =

There are typically two hurdles to successfully getting this plugin and Engaging Networks to communicate. The first and most common problem is that the API key you've entered isn't properly configured to be used from the IP address of the server you're using this plugin on â€” make sure to check with your host if you have questions about what IP address to enter into Engaging Networks.

A second, less-common problem is that your EN account is on a different server than this plugin assumes: While "www.e-activist.com" is the default, some EN accounts may be on "us.e-activist.com" or some other domain. To make this change, you'll need to add some code to your site (either in your theme or a plugin) to change it. The filter is called `gf_en_api_base_url` and here's an example use:

	function mytheme_change_en_url( $url ) {
		return 'https://us.e-activist.com/ens/service';
	}
	add_filter( 'gf_en_api_base_url', 'mytheme_change_en_url' );

= Does this work with Ninja Forms, Contact Form 7, Jetpack, etc? =

Nope. This is specifically an Add-On for Gravity Forms and will not have any effect if installed an activated without it.

= What version of Gravity Forms do I need? =

You must be running at least Gravity Forms 1.9.3.

= What kinds of data can this pass to Engaging Networks? =

As of 2.0, this Add-On can pass *basic constituent data* to EN as well as Page Builder form submissions.

Page submissions can include custom supporter fields and Opt-Ins, although as of now the EN API does not provide a way for this plugin to "know" which fields are present or required on a given Page. (We hope the EN API will eventually expose a list of optional and required fields shown on a given Page so that we can simplifyy this Add-On's interface and be more confident form submissions will be successful, but until then, you'll have to wing it.)
